### Configuring Remote Hosts

 not implemented yet


## Todo

* convert configuration to a ConfigParser compatible format
* read the config directory for configfiles (one per remote host)
* create config GUI
    * config gui should list available configurations in a comboeditbox
        * changing the entry will mean saving it creates a new configuration file
        * provide two buttons, save and delete
